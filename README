THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE.  DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU WANT TO FINISH IT! :P

ModelingClay is an ORM for Node.js written in CoffeeScript.

I was inspired mostly by Django's ORM, but I also have borrowed some ideas from Rails.  It is my hope that this library will help others accelerate their node projects.

The entire project is test driven, and you can run tests by running the script called "sentrygun" in the bin folder.

I will accept pull requests only if they come with properly written specs.  Forgetting to write tests will get you ignored.  Sorry but I want this to be a rock-solid library, so tests are a must!
